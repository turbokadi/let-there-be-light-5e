## FAQ:

### What if I create a character with darkvision 120 trait ?

Darkvision 120 trait is applied the token directly.

### If I decide to equip a Torch on my character ?

The Torch light stats are applied to your character directly when you equipped it (20ft bright, 20ft dim, Torch animation, etc ...).

### If I decide to equip a Lamp as well ?

You can't have more than one light source equipped, the Lamp will be unequipped.
